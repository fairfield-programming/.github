## Welcome to the Fairfield Programming Association!
We are an open-source, non-profit dedicated to the education of children in the world of computer science. We host competitions, events, and websites in order to forward the learning experience of highschool and college students. Since we are a non-profit and an open-source organization, we would love it if you contribute or donate, but that is fully up to you!
